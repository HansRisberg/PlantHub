This was our groups graduation project. It was completed over a two week period.

We used ASP.NET Core, MVC design, MS SQL, Entity Framework, React/JavaScript, MaterialUI

A big part of the project was getting exercise in agile development and the process of creating an idea into an MVP with a presentation. 
That included UX-design and prototype production for user testing. 

The app uses googlemaps to register the location of the user, so they can easily see what plant/plant-clippings are available close by. There are some sorting functions when searching for plants as well. 
It also uses an api designed to show plantcare information based on the species of plant you are looking at (Water needs, light needs ect).
